                        The enemy spawning mechanic is one of the key component in our game. We had to make sure that it handles spawning multiple enemies
                        while having different cooldown timer for each of the enemies. We also had to make sure that the enemy walks in a 1 single lane.

            <h2>Team Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <span>Our team reflection on the development of Spring Defense reveals both accomplishments and areas for improvement. While we faced challenges in team communication and time management, we successfully created a playable game with various levels and mechanics. We take pride in our dedication to refining the gameplay experience, which resulted in an engaging and enjoyable product. However, it is essential to acknowledge our shortcomings in communication and time management, which impacted our development process. Moving forward, we aim to improve these areas and implement strategies such as regular check-ins and project management tools to enhance our collaboration.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Given an additional two weeks, we have identified exciting features to enhance Spring Defense further. Expanding the game with more levels, animations, enemies, and an upgrade feature will provide players with extended gameplay, visual appeal, and a sense of progression. We recognize the value of player engagement and replayability, and these additions will contribute to a more immersive and enjoyable experience. Reflecting on our past experiences, we are committed to addressing our communication and time management challenges to ensure a more efficient and productive workflow in future projects.
